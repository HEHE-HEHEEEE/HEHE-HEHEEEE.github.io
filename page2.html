        <h2>How We started</h2>
        <p>It all started with a Yo from your side and a Hi from my side over a call, in fact not even ours. 
        And then a "hey" message from your side and a Hi from my side. 
        That took me to here, living my life with the most important person in my life.
        Isn't it fascinating that something so small, a simple conversation, grew into something so much larger. 
        We shared memories, laughed at jokes, and lost ourselves in experiences that seemed truer than any reality could ever have been. 
        Every conversation, every look, every "Hey" and "Yo" became a part of creating this bond, one that I cherish in my life today.

        <h2>The First Time We Met</h2>
        <p>Our first meeting was just amazing and so random from talking over the phone to me suddenly asking, "Should I come and meet you when you arrive?"
            Both of us were nervous, scared. (Cheenu: "I will handle you." lol you were more nervous than me) Meeting for the first time, neither of us knew exactly what to expect.
            And then, I finally saw you. At that moment, only two thoughts ran through my mind: Will she like me? and Is she taller than me?
            Then came our first hug magical. Everything around us just went silent, numb, as if the world had paused for us. I just wanted to hold you longer, to stay in that moment forever.
            That hug led to our first kiss... which, let’s be honest, was a complete failure (sorry, lol). But then, came our actual first kiss, and all I have to say is DAMNNNN.
            And when I rested my head on your shoulder, that was it. That was the moment I knew—Fuck, she’s the one. It’s either her or no one else
